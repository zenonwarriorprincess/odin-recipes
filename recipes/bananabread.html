    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You won't find many newer recipes floating around today that require sour milk,
        but Grandma Margaret found it pertinent for maximum moisture and flavor. If you're
        completing averse, or just don't have any handy, you can substitute with cream.</p>
        <b></b>
        <p>Grandma Margaret believed the additon of 1 cup of nuts of your choice made this
            sweet treat into a well-rounded breakfast. If you're allergic to nuts in your baked
            goods (like me) then you'll be glad to know dark chocolate chips will also provide
            some depth.
